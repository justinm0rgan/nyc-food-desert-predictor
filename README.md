# NYC Food Desert Predictor
# (Currently in process 12/9 - 1/6)
Flatiron Capstone Project: Develop regression models that predict food deserts at a census tract level for NYC 5 boroughs

## Overview

## Business Case

## Data

_Low-income tract_ - A tract with either poverty rate of 20 percent or more, or a median family income less than 80 percent of surrounding metropolitan area median family income

_Low-access tract_ - A tract with at least 500 people, or 33 percent of the population, living more than 1/2 mile from the nearest supermarket, supercenter, or large grocery store.

**Target**
_Low-income and low-access tract measured at .5 mile Urban_ (LILAhalf) - A low-income tract with at least 500 people, or 33 percent of the population, living more than 1/2 mile from the nearest supermarket, supercenter, or large grocery store.
